Conditions governing conditional release orders\\n    Conditions on a conditional release order are imposed by the sentencing court under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (see Part 8 of that Act) or by a court under section 108D.\\n\\n\\n108B Administration of conditional release orders and obligations of offenders\\n        (1) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to\\u2014\\n            (a) the administration of conditional release orders, including any conditions of those orders, whether by the establishment of a scheme for their management or otherwise, and\\n            (b) without limitation\\u2014\\n                (i) any matter relating to carrying out or complying with any of the conditions of a conditional release order (including, for example, a condition relating to supervision), and\\n                (ii) the functions of persons involved in the administration of conditional release orders, and\\n                (iii) the manner in which an offender\\u2019s failure to comply with the offender\\u2019s obligations under a conditional release order may be dealt with, and\\n                (iv) the service of notices on an offender.\\n        (2) The obligations of an offender under a conditional release order, including the obligations of an offender under a condition of the order, are to be as prescribed by the regulations.\\n\\n\\n108C Breach of conditional release order\\n        (1) If it suspects that an offender may have failed to comply with any of the conditions of a conditional release order\\u2014\\n            (a) the court that made the order, or\\n            (b) any other court of like jurisdiction, or\\n            (c) with the offender\\u2019s consent, any other court of superior jurisdiction,\\n        may call on the offender to appear before it.\\n        (2) If the offender fails to appear, the court may\\u2014\\n            (a) issue a warrant for the offender\\u2019s arrest, or\\n            (b) authorise an authorised officer to issue a warrant for the offender\\u2019s arrest.\\n        (3) If, however, at the time the court proposes to call on an offender to appear before it, the court is satisfied that the location of the offender is unknown, the court may immediately\\u2014\\n            (a) issue a warrant for the offender\\u2019s arrest, or\\n            (b) authorise an authorised officer to issue a warrant for the offender\\u2019s arrest.\\n        (4) For the purposes of subsection (1) (c), a court is of superior jurisdiction to the court that made the conditional release order if it is a court to which the offender has (or has had) a right of appeal in respect of the conviction or sentence from which the order arises.\\n        (5) If it is satisfied that an offender appearing before it has failed to comply with any of the conditions of a conditional release order, a court\\u2014\\n            (a) may decide to take no action in respect of the failure to comply, or\\n            (b) may vary or revoke any conditions of the order (other than standard conditions) or impose further conditions on the order, or\\n            (c) may revoke the order.\\n        (6) To avoid doubt, the court that made an order may deal with a breach of a conditional release order even though the court is constituted differently from the court as constituted at the time the order was made.\\n        (6A) A court may exercise any function under this section in relation to a conditional release order after the order has expired, but only in respect of matters arising during the term of the order.\\n        (7) In this section\\u2014\\n        authorised officer has the same meaning as it has in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.\\n\\n\\n108D Consequences of revocation of conditional release order\\n        (1) If a court revokes a conditional release order, it may sentence or re-sentence the offender for the offence to which the order relates.\\n        (2) The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applies to the sentencing or re-sentencing of an offender under this section in the same way as it applies to the sentencing of an offender found guilty of the offence concerned.\\n        (3) An offender who under this section is sentenced by a court for an offence has the same rights of appeal as the offender would have had if the offender had been sentenced by that court on being found guilty of the offence concerned.\\n\\n\\n108E Suspension of certain conditions of conditional release order\\n        (1) This section applies to the following conditions of a conditional release order\\u2014\\n            (a) a condition referred to in section 99 (2) (e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (a supervision condition),\\n            (b) a non-association condition or place restriction condition referred to in section 99 (2) of that Act.\\n        (2) A community corrections officer may, by order in writing and subject to the regulations, suspend the application of a supervision condition to an offender for a period or periods or indefinitely.\\n        (3) A community corrections officer may, by order given orally or in writing and subject to the regulations, suspend the application of any other condition to which this section applies to an offender for a period or periods.\\n        (4) The suspension may be unconditional or subject to conditions.\\n        (5) For the purposes of this Act, a failure to comply with a condition of the suspension is taken to be a failure to comply with the obligations of the conditional release order. This subsection does not limit the power of the community corrections officer to revoke the suspension order.\\n        (6) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the following\\u2014\\n            (a) the periods for which a condition may be suspended,\\n            (b) notice to an offender of the making or revocation of a suspension order,\\n            (c) requiring the power to make, amend or revoke a suspension order to be exercised subject to and in accordance with any specified requirements.\\n        (7) A reference in this section to a community corrections officer is, in relation to an offender who is subject to supervision or management by a juvenile justice officer, taken to be a reference to a juvenile justice officer.\\n        (8) If a supervision condition is suspended by a juvenile justice officer and the offender has reached the age of 18 years, a community corrections officer may revoke the suspension order.\\n\\n\\nPart 5

The Parole Authority must consider whether or not a serious offender should be released on parole at least 60 days before the offender\\u2019s parole eligibility date.\\n        (2) Despite subsection (1), the Parole Authority may defer consideration of an offender\\u2019s case until not less than 21 days before the offender\\u2019s parole eligibility date if it is of the opinion\\u2014\\n            (a) that it is unable to complete its consideration because it has not been furnished with a report required to be made to it, or\\n            (b) that there are other relevant matters requiring further consideration.\\n\\n\\n143A Consideration of parole in subsequent years\\n        (1) At any time within 90 days before an offender\\u2019s annual review date, the offender, if still eligible

practicable after forming an initial intention not to make a parole order for a serious offender, the Parole Authority\\u2014\\n            (a) must give notice of its intention to the offender,

placed before it, the Parole Authority must decide\\u2014\\n            (a) whether or not the offender should be released on parole, or\\n            (b) whether, for reasons specified by the Parole Authority in its minutes, the question of whether or not the offender should be released on parole should be deferred.\\n        (2) The question of whether or not the offender should be released on parole\\u2014\\n            (a) may be deferred once only, and\\n            (b) may not be deferred for more than 2 months.\\n        (3) If the Parole Authority decides than the offender should be released on parole, it must make an order directing the release of the offender on parole on a day occurring during a period specified in accordance with section 151.\\n        (4) If the Parole Authority decides that the offender should not be released on parole, the Parole Authority\\u2014\\n            (a) (Repealed)\\n            (b) must cause notice that it does not intend to make a

period to be specified in a parole order under section 149 or 150 is to be\\u2014\\n            (a) if the order is made earlier than 14 days before the offender\\u2019s parole eligibility date (other than an order made following consideration of the offender\\u2019s case under section 143B), a period beginning no earlier than the offender\\u2019s parole eligibility date and ending no later than 21 days after that date, and\\n            (a1) if the order is made following an application by the offender referred to in section 143A, and is made before the offender\\u2019s annual review date (within the meaning of that section), a period beginning no earlier than the offender\\u2019s annual review date and ending no later than 35 days after that date, and\\n            (b) in any other case, a period beginning no earlier than 14 days after the date on which the order is made and ending no later than 35 days after that date.\\n        (1A) In determining a day on which to release a

application is made to the Supreme Court within 14 days after a parole order is made, the order is suspended\\u2014\\n            (a) until the application is dealt with by the Court or the application is withdrawn, or\\n            (b) if the direction of the Supreme Court includes a requirement that the Parole Authority reconsider its decision in the light of the direction, until the Parole Authority revokes the order or confirms it with or without modifications.\\n        (3) Any such suspension automatically lapses at the end of the period of 28 days after the date on which a direction referred to in subsection (2) (b) is given if during that period the Parole Authority neither revokes the parole order nor confirms it with or without modifications.\\n\\n\\n152 Reasons to

Council may make submissions to the Parole Authority concerning the rejection of its advice within 21 days of that rejection.\\n        (4) The Parole Authority is not to make a final decision concerning the release of the offender during the period referred to in subsection (3).\\n\\n\\n153 Submissions by State\\n        (1) The State may at any time make submissions to the Parole

    Note\\u2014\\n        The Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 and the Terrorism (High Risk Offenders) Act 2017 authorise the use by the State of certain information obtained under those Acts in parole proceedings under this Act, but only with the consent of the provider of the information.\\n        (2) If the State makes any such submission before the Parole Authority makes a final decision concerning the release of the offender, the Parole Authority must not make such a decision without taking the submission into account.\\n        (3) If the State makes any such submission after the Parole Authority makes a final decision concerning the release of the offender, but before the offender is released, the Parole Authority must consider whether or not it should exercise its power under section 130 to revoke the relevant parole order.\\n        (4) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to submissions by the State under this section, including provisions relating to the application of this Subdivision in connection with any such submission.\\n        (5) The powers of the State under this section may be exercised by the Commissioner and by any other authority of the State.\\n\\n\\n153A Withdrawal of offender information provided under Terrorism (High Risk Offenders) Act 2017\\n        (1) This section applies to proceedings for parole before the Parole Authority in which information is used under the authority given by section 71A of the Terrorism (High Risk Offenders) Act 2017.\\n\\n\\n        Note\\u2014\\n        Section 71A of the Terrorism (High Risk Offenders) Act 2017 authorises the use by the State of certain information obtained under that Act in proceedings for parole under this Act, but only with the consent of the provider of the information.\\n        (2) The Parole Authority must allow the State or a prescribed terrorism intelligence authority to withdraw the information from the consideration of the Parole Authority at any time before the proceedings are determined.\\n        (3) Any offender information that is withdrawn from the consideration of the Parole Authority must not be\\u2014\\n            (a) used in making submissions for the State in the proceedings, or\\n            (b) taken into consideration by the Parole Authority in determining the proceedings.\\n        (4) In this section\\u2014\\n        offender information has the same meaning as in Part 5 of the Terrorism (High Risk Offenders) Act 2017.\\n        prescribed terrorism intelligence authority has the same meaning as in the Terrorism (High Risk Offenders) Act 2017.\\n\\n\\n154 Matters to be considered concerning certain serious offenders\\n        (1) This section applies to a serious offender whose

the sentencing court, and\\n            (b) must give consideration to adopting or giving effect to any such recommendations, observations and comments and to the intention of the sentencing court when making them, and\\n            (c) to the extent that it declines to adopt or give effect to any such recommendations, observations and comments, must state its reasons for doing so,\\n        and must, in particular, have regard to the need to preserve the safety of the community.\\n\\n\\n154A Serious offenders the subject of non-release recommendations\\n        (1) Section 143 does not require the Parole Authority to give preliminary consideration as to whether or not a serious offender the subject of a non-release recommendation should be released on parole unless an application for that purpose is made to the Parole Authority by or on behalf of the offender.\\n        (2) An application under this section must be lodged with the Secretary of the Parole Authority.\\n        (3) After considering the application, the Parole Authority may make an order directing the release of the offender on parole if, and only if, the Parole Authority\\u2014\\n            (a) is satisfied (on the basis of a report prepared by the Chief Executive, Justice Health) that the offender\\u2014\\n                (i) is in imminent danger of dying, or is incapacitated to the extent that he or she no longer has the physical ability to do harm to any person, and\\n                (ii) has demonstrated that he or she does not pose a risk to the community, and\\n            (b) is further satisfied that, because of those circumstances, the making of such an order is justified.\\n        (4) In this section serious offender the subject of a non-release recommendation means a serious offender\\u2014\\n            (a) who is serving a sentence for which a determination has been made under clause 4 of Schedule 1 to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and\\n            (b) who is the subject of a non-release recommendation within the meaning of that Schedule, as in force from time to time.\\n\\n\\nSubdivision 4 Applications to Supreme Court\\n\\n\\n155 Application to Supreme Court by offender\\n        (1) If\\u2014\\n            (a) the Parole Authority decides that an offender should not be released on parole, and\\n            (b) the offender alleges that the decision of the Parole Authority has been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information,\\n        the offender may, in accordance with rules of court, apply to the Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant.\\n        (2) The Supreme Court may give such directions with respect to the information as it thinks fit.\\n        (3) An application under this section is to be considered by the Supreme Court if and only if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application.\\n        (4) This section does not give the Supreme Court jurisdiction to consider the merits of the Parole Authority\\u2019s decision otherwise than on the grounds referred to in subsection (1).\\n\\n\\n156 Application to Supreme Court by State\\n        (1) If\\u2014\\n            (a) the Parole Authority

Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant.\\n        (2) The Supreme Court may give such directions with respect to the information as it thinks fit.\\n        (3) This section does not give the Supreme Court jurisdiction to consider the merits of the Parole Authority\\u2019s decision otherwise than on the grounds referred to in subsection (1).\\n\\n\\n157 Appearance in person of offender\\n        (1) At the hearing or determination of an application under this Subdivision, an offender is not entitled to appear in person, except by leave of the Supreme Court.\\n        (2) The power of the Supreme Court to grant an offender leave to appear in person at the hearing or determination of an application under this Subdivision may be exercised by any Judge of that Court, but no appeal lies to that Court against the refusal of a Judge of that Court to grant leave to appear.\\n\\n\\nDivision 3 Parole orders for sentences of 3 years or less\\n\\n\\n158 Statutory parole order\\n        (1) An offender who is subject to a sentence of 3 years or less, being a sentence for which a non-parole

whether or not the order has expired, conduct an inquiry into the matter.\\n        (1A) In the case of an offender who has been granted parole on the grounds that he or she is in imminent danger of dying or is incapacitated to the extent that he or she no longer has the physical ability to do harm to any person, as referred to in section 154A (3), the Parole Authority may also conduct an inquiry if it suspects that those grounds no longer exist.\\n        (2) The offender to whom the parole order relates may make submissions to the Parole Authority in relation to the matters under inquiry.\\n        (3) The Parole Authority is not required to inquire into a possible contravention of a parole order made by a court unless the offender to whom the order relates is required by the conditions of the order to be supervised.\\n\\n\\n170 Actions by Commissioner or community corrections officer on non-compliance with parole order\\n        (1) This section applies if the Commissioner or a

of the following actions\\u2014\\n            (a) record the breach and take no further action,\\n            (b) give an informal warning to the offender,\\n            (c) give, or arrange to be given to, the offender a formal warning that further breaches will result in referral to the Parole Authority,\\n            (d) give a reasonable direction to the offender relating to the kind of behaviour by the offender that caused the breach,\\n            (e) impose a curfew on the offender of up to 12 hours in any 24 hour period.\\n        (3) As an alternative, or in addition, to taking any such action, the Commissioner or a community corrections officer may decide to refer the breach to the Parole Authority because of the serious nature of the breach and may also make a recommendation as to the action that the Parole Authority may take in respect of the offender.\\n        (4) In deciding whether and what action should be taken in respect of the offender\\u2019s breach of the parole order, the Commissioner or a community corrections officer may have regard to any action previously taken in respect of the breach or any earlier breaches of the order.\\n        (5) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to any action that may be taken by a community corrections officer under this section.\\n\\n\\n170A Actions by Parole Authority on

imposing a requirement that the offender remain at the offender\\u2019s place of residence for a period of home detention of up to 30 days,\\n            (b) a condition that the offender must submit to the use of an electronic monitoring device,\\n            (c) ancillary conditions relating to any condition imposed under this section.\\n        (4) In deciding whether and what action should be taken in respect of the offender\\u2019s breach of the parole order, the Parole Authority may have regard to any action previously taken in respect of the breach or any earlier breaches of the order.\\n        (5) Section 124H and any regulations made under section 124J (e) apply to an offender who is subject to a condition of home detention imposed under this section in the same way as they apply to an offender who is subject to a re-integration home detention order.\\n        (6) Before determining whether to impose a condition imposing a period of home detention under this section, the Parole Authority is to obtain, and consider, a report prepared by a community corrections officer as to the suitability of the offender for home detention.\\n\\n\\n170B Circumstances for

sufficiently mitigated by directions from a community corrections officer or by changing the conditions of parole, or\\n            (b) if it is satisfied that there is a serious and immediate risk that the offender will leave New South Wales in contravention of the conditions of the parole order and that the risk cannot be sufficiently mitigated by directions from a community corrections officer or by changing the conditions of parole, or\\n            (c) if it is satisfied that the offender has failed to comply with the offender\\u2019s obligations under a re-integration home detention order, or\\n            (d) if a re-integration home detention order applying to the offender is revoked, or\\n            (e) in the case of an offender who has been granted parole on the grounds that he or she is in imminent danger of dying or is incapacitated to the extent that he or she no longer has the physical ability to do harm to any person, as referred to in section 154A (3) (a), if it is satisfied that those grounds no longer exist, or\\n            (f) in the case of an offender who has been granted parole under section 160 on the grounds that he or she is dying or because of exceptional extenuating circumstances, if it is satisfied that those grounds or circumstances no longer exist, or\\n            (g) if the offender fails to appear before the Parole Authority when called on to do so under section 180, or\\n            (h) if the offender has applied for the order to be revoked.\\n        (2) The Parole Authority may make a parole revocation order

inquiry.\\n        (2) A parole revocation order takes effect, or is taken to have taken effect, on the date on which it is made or on any earlier date that the Parole Authority thinks fit.\\n        (3) The earliest date on which a parole revocation order resulting from a breach of the obligations of the offender under the parole order may take effect is the date of the first occasion on which it appears to the Parole Authority that the offender failed to comply with the offender\\u2019s obligations under the parole order.\\n        (4) If an offender is not taken into custody until after the day on which the parole revocation order takes effect, the term of the offender\\u2019s sentence is, by this subsection, extended by the number of days the person was at large after the order took

The local council for the town, Wakool Shire Council ('the Council'), granted development consent to Jonesy's Dairy Fresh Pty Ltd to use an existing industrial building at 49 Parkman Avenue, Barham ('the land') for a dairy processing plant. Many local residents of the town oppose the proposed dairy processing plant.\\n2One of the residents, Mr Simpson, has brought judicial review proceedings challenging the validity of the Council's decision to grant development consent. The grounds of review are basically twofold: first, procedural impropriety by the Council failing to notify affected land owners and occupiers of the development application as required by Development Control Plan No 8 - Notification Policy ('DCP 8'), and secondly, irrationality by the Council failing to consider the relevant matters of the noise and odour impacts of the proposed dairy processing plant on surrounding residential properties. Mr Simpson claims the Council's decision and the development consent should be set aside.\\n3The Council entered a submitting appearance save as to costs. The consent holder, Jonesy's Dairy Fresh Pty Ltd, defended the proceedings.\\n4The consent holder contests that the Council's decision was affected by procedural impropriety or irrationality in the ways claimed by Mr Simpson. It submits that the Council was not obliged to comply with the notification requirements of DCP 8 and the Council did consider the relevant matters of the impacts of noise and odour. If, however, the Council did err by failing to give notification of the proposed development or to consider noise and odour impacts, the consent holder submits the Court should exercise its discretion not to set aside the development consent, either inherent in the power to remedy the breach or under s 25B of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 ('Court Act').\\n5I find the Council's exercise of power to grant the development consent has miscarried by the Council failing to give proper notification of the proposed development, in breach of the applicable statutory requirements. However, I find that Mr Simpson has not established that the Council failed to consider the relevant matters of noise and odour impacts of the proposed development. I consider that the appropriate remedy for the breach of the notification requirements is to declare the development consent invalid. I do not consider it appropriate to exercise the discretion not to make a declaration of invalidity.\\n\\n\\nFailure to notify the development application\\n\\n\\nThe applicable statutory requirements\\n6The land is zoned 2(v) (Village or Urban Zone) under the applicable Wakool Local Environmental Plan 1992 ('LEP'). In that zone, development for the purposes of 'industry' or 'rural industry' is permissible with consent. The proposed dairy processing plant was for either of these purposes.\\n7Pursuant to s 29A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 ('EPA Act'), cl 21 of the LEP identifies certain development as advertised development for the purposes of the EPA Act. The development identified as advertised development is development for the purposes specified in sch 2 of the LEP. The proposed development of a dairy processing plant is not development for any of the purposes specified in sch 2 of the LEP. Hence, the proposed development is not identified as advertised development by the LEP.\\n8Two development control plans, adopted by the Council under what was then s 72 of the EPA Act, apply to the land. The first is Development Control Plan No 1 - Shire of Wakool ('DCP 1'). DCP 1 applies to parts of five villages in the Shire of Wakool, including Barham, shown on Maps 1 and 2 of DCP 1. The land is within a part of the village of Barham shown on these maps. DCP 1 divides land to which DCP 1 applies into precincts. The land is within Precinct 4(a) - Industrial. DCP 1 represents the Council's policy for land use precincts (cl 3.1 of DCP 1). For the industrial precinct, the policy is to concentrate industrial activities in the industrial precinct to avoid conflict between industrial land use and other uses (cl 4.3(a)(i) of DCP 1). Use for the purposes of industry or rural industry is permissible with consent in the industrial precinct.\\n9DCP 1 requires notice to be given of certain proposed developments in the industrial precinct. Clause 4.3(a)(ii) provides:\\nAny proposed development of vacant industrial land or change of land use within an existing industrial premises will require written notification to the adjoining property owners and occupants prior to the application being determined by Council. The notice shall allow a fourteen (14) day period for any submissions to be lodged with Council.\\n10The second development control plan is DCP 8. DCP 8 applies to all land within the Shire of Wakool. Hence, it applies to the land. DCP 8 provides requirements for public notification of proposed development additional to the public notification requirements in the EPA Act, Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000 ('EPA Regulation') and cl 21 of the LEP. DCP 8 states that it 'applies where the proposed development is not required to be advertised under state or federal legislation; or is not listed in the Wakool Local Environmental Plan 1992: Schedule 2 - Development which must be advertised'. As I have noted, the proposed development of the dairy processing plant is not development identified in sch 2 of the LEP as development which must be advertised. DCP 8 identifies particular purposes of development to which the notification policy in DCP 8 applies. Industries in the zone 2(v) (Village or Urban Zone) are such development. DCP 8 states the notification that is required:\\nBoth owners and occupiers of land that adjoins a site where an application has been received and owners and occupiers of land that may be affected by a development proposal will be notified in writing. Adjoining land will include land that is opposite or directly abuts a site, or is separated from it only by a pathway, driveway, laneway or similar thoroughfare.\\nCouncil reserves the right to notify any public authority likely to be affected, or any other individual, organization, group or similar that may be affected by the proposal.\\nNotification will include the address of the subject premises, applicants' details, a brief description of the development, details of where and when the application can be viewed, and details of the period in which Council will accept submissions.\\nApplications can be inspected for a period of seven (7) days. Details of this period will be provided in the notification letter.\\n11Section 79A of the EPA Act requires proposed development identified as advertised development or specified as other notifiable development to be advertised or notified in accordance with the applicable requirements for advertising or notification. In particular, s 79A(2) provides:\\nA development application for specified development (other than designated development or advertised development) must be notified or advertised in accordance with the provisions of a development control plan if the development control plan provides for the notification or advertising of the application.\\n\\n\\nThe notification given\\n12The Council did give notice of the proposed development. However, it did so under DCP 1 only and not under DCP 8. Hence, it gave notice only to adjoining landowners, being seven persons who own six parcels of land to the north, east and south of the land.\\n13The written notice was in the form of a letter dated 12 August 2011 identifying the development application ('development application 31/11'), the address of the land ('Lot 47, 94 & 115 DP 756508 - 49 Parkman Avenue, Barham'), the applicant's details ('Jonesy's Dairy Fresh Pty Ltd'), a brief description of the development ('change of use to a dairy processing plant producing cheese, yoghurt and flavoured milk'), details of where and when the application could be viewed ('the full application is available for viewing at the Barham Office during normal business hours'), and details of the period in which the Council would accept submissions ('Any objection to the proposal must be in writing, and addressed to the General Manager, Wakool Shire Council, Private Bag 40, Moulamein 2733. It must reach Council no later than 4pm Friday 26 August 2011').\\n14The letter enclosed a proforma response form which could be used by persons wishing to comment or lodge an objection. The letter also enclosed the proposed site plan for the development.\\n15Three of the people notified by the Council lodged objections to the proposed development, completing the proforma response form.\\n\\n\\nThe notification was defective\\n16Mr Simpson submits that the Council's notification of the development application was defective because the Council did not comply with the notification requirements of DCP 8 that were applicable. I agree.\\n17DCP 8 requires notification to be given not only to owners and occupiers of land that adjoins the proposed development site but also to owners and occupiers of land that may be affected by the development proposal. The Council only ever sought to notify immediately adjoining owners. This was because the Council only sought to comply with the requirements of DCP 1. DCP 1 only requires notification to be given to 'the adjoining property owners and occupants'. The Council never sought to apply DCP 8 and hence did not consider who might be 'owners and occupiers of land that may be affected by' the proposed development. That the Council only considered and applied DCP 1, and not DCP 8, is evident from the council officer's report to the ordinary council meeting on 21 September 2011, which states expressly that, '[a]s required by DCP No. 1 the application was notified to immediately adjoining owners', as well as from the notification letters themselves which all stated that each of the persons being notified is 'an adjoining landowner'. Nowhere in the Council's file, or in the evidence before the Court, is there any indication that the Council considered DCP 8, or sought to give notification as required by DCP 8.\\n18The Council was required, under s 79C(1)(a)(iii) of the EPA Act, to take into consideration the provisions of any applicable development control plan. DCP 8 was an applicable development control plan that the Council was required to take into consideration.\\n19DCP 8 provides the notification policy for development applications for development of all land in the Shire of Wakool, including specifying the classes of persons to whom notification is required to be given (stated in the section 'Notification format' in DCP 8). Taking DCP 8 into consideration for a particular development application entails identifying the particular persons who fall within the classes of persons to whom notification is required to be given under DCP 8. The Council was, therefore, required to identify not only the owners and occupiers of land that adjoins the site of the proposed development of the dairy processing plant but also the owners and occupiers of land that may be affected by the proposed development. Although the Council did identify the persons who were the adjoining landowners, it did not consider and identify whether there were any other owners and occupiers of land that may be affected by the proposed development. The Council thereby failed to take into consideration DCP 8.\\n20The Council's failure to consider DCP 8 led to its failure to give notification in accordance with DCP 8. The Council gave notice to owners and occupiers of land that adjoins the site of the proposed development but not to any other owner or occupier of land that may be affected by the proposed development.\\n21As a matter of fact, other owners and occupiers of land in the vicinity of the proposed development made submissions objecting to a later application to modify the development consent, and some of these persons have given evidence at the hearing, claiming that they would be adversely affected by traffic, noise, odour and amenity impacts of the proposed development. There were, therefore, owners and occupiers of land whom the Council could have considered may be affected by the proposed development and, in that event, to whom notification would therefore have needed to have been given under DCP 8.\\n22A failure to notify the development application for the proposed development in accordance with DCP 8 is a breach of s 79A(2) of the EPA Act.\\n23The consent holder does not contest that, as a matter of fact, the Council did not comply with the notification requirements in DCP 8 and, in particular, did not notify all owners and occupiers of land that may be affected by the proposed development, but the consent holder submits that the Council was not required to do so. The consent holder submits that DCP 8 did not apply because the proposed development was required to be advertised under the EPA Act (and hence the proposed development did not fall within the 'Application' section of DCP 8). The reason the consent holder submitted that the proposed development was required to be advertised under the EPA Act was that it was required to be notified under cl 4.3(a)(ii) of DCP 1. Under s 74C(1)(b) of the EPA Act, a development control plan can identify development as advertised development. Development so identified by a development control plan is 'advertised development' for the purposes of the EPA Act (see definition of 'advertised development' in s 4(1) of the EPA Act). If development is advertised development then the statutory requirements for notification would not be those provided in s 79A(2) but rather those provided in s 79A(1) of the EPA Act. The Council would not, therefore, have been required to comply with the notification requirements of DCP 8 or s 79A(2) of the Act.\\n24I reject the consent holder's argument. The facts that DCP 1 applies to the land and cl 4.3(a)(ii) requires written notification to be given to adjoining property owners and occupiers, do not make the proposed development 'advertised development' for the purposes of the EPA Act. The definition of advertised development in s 4(1) and the provisions of ss 29A(1) and 74C(1)(b) make clear that the environmental planning instrument or development control plan must 'identify development as advertised development'. Identification requires that the environmental planning instrument or development control plan specify that particular development or development of a particular class is advertised development for the purposes of the EPA Act or state that the provisions of the EPA Act and EPA Regulation regarding advertised development apply to such development.\\n25In this case, the LEP, by cl 21, does identify particular development, being development for the purposes specified in sch 2 of the LEP, as advertised development by applying the provisions of the EPA Act regarding advertised development to the identified development. The proposed development of the dairy processing plant is not one of the identified purposes of development. However, neither DCP 1 nor DCP 8 similarly identify any particular development or class of development as advertised development.\\n26Clause 4.3(a)(ii) of DCP 1 does not identify any particular development or class of development but rather applies to '[a]ny proposed development of vacant industrial land or change of land use within an existing industrial premises'. The clause does not specify that any such development is advertised development for the purposes of the EPA Act or apply the provisions of the EPA Act and the EPA Regulation regarding advertised development to any such development. Indeed, the clause does not require advertisement by way of published notice in a local newspaper (as would be required for advertised development), but rather only requires written notice to be given to adjoining landowners and occupiers.\\n27DCP 8 does specify the particular development to which DCP 8 applies but does not identify such development as advertised development by specifying that such development is advertised development for the purposes of the EPA Act or by applying the provisions of the EPA Act or EPA Regulation regarding advertised development to such development. Indeed, DCP 8 expressly excludes from its application development which is required to be advertised under the EPA Act and the LEP.\\n28Hence, the proposed development of the dairy processing plant is not identified by the LEP, DCP 1 or DCP 8 as advertised development. The notification requirements in DCP 8 are therefore applicable to the proposed development, as are those in s 79A(2) of the EPA Act.\\n29I should note that the consent holder's argument that the proposed development was advertised development would not have assisted the consent holder in any event in disproving a breach of the notification and advertising requirements. If the proposed development had been advertised development, the Council would have been required to have notified and advertised the development application in accordance with s 79A(1) of the EPA Act and cls 87-91 of the EPA Regulation. Amongst the requirements are that notice of the development application be published in a local newspaper and that the written notice to be given to adjoining landowners and occupiers state that the period for inspection and submission commences on the day after the day on which the published notice was first published in a newspaper. In this case, the Council did not publish any notice in the local newspaper of the development application and the written notice it gave to adjoining landowners and occupiers did not specify a period for inspection and submission commencing on the day after any published notice was given. Hence, the Council did not comply with the notification and advertisement requirements for advertised development in any event.\\n30In conclusion, the Council has failed to comply with the notification requirements of DCP 8 and s 79A(2) of the EPA Act in relation to the development application for the proposed dairy processing plant.\\n\\n\\nFailure to consider noise and odour impacts\\n\\n\\nNoise and odour impacts are relevant matters to consider\\n31The Council was obliged under s 79C(1) of the EPA Act, in determining the development application, to take into consideration, amongst other matters, the likely impacts of the proposed development, including environmental impacts on the natural and built environments. Local residents who made submissions objecting to the proposed development identified that it would be likely to have impacts in terms of traffic, noise and odour and on the amenity of the surrounding neighbourhood. The council officer's report assessing the development application also identified these impacts. They were relevant matters the Council was bound to take into consideration in determining the development application for the proposed development.\\n\\n\\nThe parties' competing contentions on failure to consider relevant matters\\n32Mr Simpson contends the Council failed to take into consideration the noise and odour impacts of the proposed development. Although the issues of noise and odour impact were raised by the objecting residents and the council officer, Mr Simpson contends that there was insufficient information on these impacts for the Council to discharge its duty to take these impacts into consideration. Consideration of relevant matters involves more than the matters merely being adverted to or given lip service: Weal v Bathurst City Council [2000] NSWCA 88; (2000) 111 LGERA 181 at [86]; Anderson v Director General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change [2008] NSWCA 337; (2008) 163 LGERA 400 at [58]. There needs to be an understanding of the relevant matters and their significance to the decision required to be made, as well as a process of evaluation sufficient to warrant the description of the matters being taken into consideration: Weal v Bathurst City Council at [13], [96]; Centro Properties Limited v Hurstville City Council [2004] NSWLEC 401; (2004) 135 LGERA 257 at [37]. Mr Simpson submits that the Council had identified that the information before it on noise and odour impacts of the proposed development was inadequate yet it went ahead and granted development consent notwithstanding this information deficiency. There was, Mr Simpson contends, a failure to consider the noise and odour impacts in these circumstances.\\n33Alternatively, Mr Simpson contends that the Council, in granting development consent subject to condition 2 (which provided for a trial period of 18 months) and condition 16 (which required provision of an acoustic report on noise generated from certain plant and equipment), deferred consideration of the relevant matters of noise and odour impacts: Remath Investments No 6 Pty Ltd v Botany Bay City Council (No 2) (Unreported, Land and Environment Court of NSW, Talbot J, 11 December 1996) at 9-10; Cameron v Nambucca Shire Council (1997) 95 LGERA 268 at 275-276; Weal v Bathurst City Council at [91]-[97]; Farah v Warringah Council [2006] NSWLEC 191 at [66]. This too, Mr Simpson submits, involved a failure to consider the noise and odour impacts at the time of determining to grant consent to the development application.\\n34The consent holder disputes Mr Simpson's contentions. It says the issues of traffic, noise, odour and amenity impacts of the proposed development were squarely raised in the materials before the Council, analysed, and addressed by conditions of consent. The fact that the local residents, or the Court if it had been the consent authority, might have dealt with and determined the development application differently, does not negate the adequacy of the Council's consideration of these issues.\\n35The question of whether a relevant matter has been considered is an evaluative process based on what the decision-maker has said, written or done: Anderson v Director General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change at [58], [60]. Where the decision-maker is a collegiate body such as a local council, the members of the local council can rely on the consideration and conclusions in the officer's report considered by the members: Parramatta City Council v Hale (1982) 47 LGRA 319 at 346; Hill v Woollahra Municipal Council [2003] NSWCA 106; (2003) 127 LGERA 7 at [59]; Centro Properties Limited v Hurstville City Council at [54], [55]. The officer's report that was considered and adopted by the Council in this case is evidence of what the Council as the decision-maker has said, written or done.\\n36The Council in this case determined the development application at its meeting on 21 September 2011. The Council had before it a council officer's report assessing the development application and two sets of attachments. The first attachment comprised the plans for the proposed development, a brief statement of environmental effects submitted by the applicant with the development application, and a letter from the applicant responding to the council officer's request for further information on the proposed development and its impacts. The second attachment comprised the three letters of objection from local residents.\\n37The consent holder submits that these information materials were sufficient to enable the Council to consider the noise and odour impacts of the proposed development and that the Council, by adopting the officer's recommendation and determining to grant development consent on the conditions it did, actually considered the impacts of noise and odour at the time of granting consent and did not defer consideration of the matters.\\n\\n\\nFailure to consider relevant matters not established\\n38I agree with the consent holder that Mr Simpson has not established either that the Council had insufficient information to discharge its duty to consider the impacts of noise and odour or that the Council did not in fact take into consideration the impacts of noise and odour in determining the development application for the proposed development.\\n39First, the Council was informed of the essential characteristics of the development. The development application proposed a change of use and fitout of an existing industrial building, which was formerly used as an office facility/process plant for water treatment plants by the former Wakool Water. The Council owned the land and was selling it to the applicant. The Council must be presumed to have knowledge of the land and the existing building on the land that it owned. The plans submitted with the development application (and attached to the officer's report before the Council) showed the existing factory and the re-use proposed. The officer's report described the proposed development, including the following summary:\\n2.Description of the development\\nThe applicant intends to establish and operate a dairy processing plant comprising the following elements and details:\\n(i)producing flavoured milk, skim milk, yoghurt (including drinking, flavoured and Greek style), cheese (camembert, brie, hard);\\n(ii)potential to process up to 1.4 million litres of milk;\\n(iii)30,000 litre inward milk silo, 12,000 litre outward storage silo;\\n(iv)pasteurizer for milk treatment;\\n(v)separator - separate butterfat from the milk;\\n(vi)4 vats for cheese making - approximately 1,000 litres each;\\n(vii)boiler and water chiller;\\n(viii)Stated hours of operation:\\nInitially one shift per day, 7am - 6pm Monday to Friday.\\nWith growth of the business a second shift is proposed entailing hours of operation from 6am to 12am Monday to Friday.\\nDelivery of milk to the premises on Sundays if required (times not specified).\\nThe applicant has also stated that once the plant is established it is intended to show case local product and set up a tearoom in the mezzanine floor area to provide tastings and buy local product. It is hoped to attract busloads of tourists as well as private individuals.\\nAn extract of the lodged DA plans and other relevant documentation is at Attachment 1.\\n40Attachment 1 to the officer's report contained information submitted by the applicant in support of the development application, including a description of the development. In the supplementary letter of 2 August 2011 (also attached to the officer's report before the Council), the applicant said:\\nProcessing Procedure\\nMilk will be brought in from the farm in a raw state, it will be then placed in a holding silo and processed as required. The first stage of this will be pasteurization, which requires the milk to be heated to 72 degrees and held for 3 seconds. The butterfat will be separated from the milk depending on the product to be made it will be directed to either cheese manufacturing or flavoured milks or other products.\\nProducts to be generated\\nFlavoured milk\\nSkim Milk\\nDrinking Yoghurt\\nCamembert Cheese\\nBrie Cheese\\nHard Cheese\\nFlavoured yoghurts\\nGreek style yoghurt\\nDescription of the Major Plant\\nInward milk storage silo - 30,000 litres.\\nOutward storage silo for whey 12,000 litres.\\nPasteurizer for the treatment of milk.\\nSeparator to separate butterfat from milk.\\n4 vats for cheesemaking. Approx. 1,000 litres each.\\nWater chillers.\\nBoiler.\\nCapacity of the equipment\\nThe pasteurizer and the separator have the capacity to do 4,000 litres per hour. However it is not intended that these will operate for long periods of time and the processing at the plant will be small scale and labour intensive compared to big milk processors.\\nWe anticipate that [in] financial year 2013-2014 that we would process ... approximately 1.4m litres of milk, this is our best estimate as it is difficult to project too far forward at this stage.\\n41Secondly, the Council was informed of the issues raised by objectors and the Council's Senior Health and Building Surveyor relating to noise, odour, traffic generation and amenity. These issues were discussed in the officer's report before the Council. The 'considerable concern' raised by objectors was summarised in a table in the officer's report:\\nIssue               Detail\\nNoise               Concerns in relation to noise include noise from:\\n                    traffic using the site, vehicles loading and unloading and noise being more of an impact during night time hours;\\n                    refrigeration units.\\nOdour               Concerns are held for potential odour from the processes involved and from break downs and spills.\\nTraffic generation  Concerns are held for the nature and volume of additional traffic in the locality including dust from Parkham [sic] Avenue and noise associated with increased truck movements.\\nAmenity             From the above issues concerns are held for the proposal to adversely impact the amenity and lifestyle of existing (and future) residents in the locality.\\n\\n\\n42Copies of the three submissions made by objectors were attached to the officer's report before the Council. The first submission stated:\\nAs we have plans for the development of 32 house blocks directly alongside this factory we have huge reservations in regard to odour and noise issues which may devalue our investment significantly. Having spoken to someone who has worked in a cheese factory for years, I would seriously question the merit of building one in such a central urban area. Break-downs and spills are inevitable and a factory working nightshift is bound to have noise issues including traffic.\\n43The second submission stated:\\nMy concern re this development is the odour level that will come from this processing plant also the level of noise from refrigeration units, and who and how these will be monitored.\\n44The third submission stated:\\nWe have a granny flat in our backyard where Les' mother who is in her 80's resides. We are concerned about the impact of the factory on her lifestyle as well as our own. A factory producing cheese and yoghurt would surely have odour issues, the traffic on Parkman Ave (dirt road dust, the noise from trucks loading, unloading, cleaning machinery) - probably not huge through the day - but working 24 hours would not be tolerable.\\n45The officer's report noted that the Council's Senior Health and Building Surveyor had raised concerns about the proposed development and the sufficiency of information provided in the development application. The whole of the Senior Health and Building Surveyor's memorandum dated 22 August 2011 was quoted in the officer's report. In relation to the issues of noise and odour, the Senior Health and Building Surveyor said:\\nThere appears to be no detail on the location or noise reduction method proposed for the compressors that will be required for the refrigeration system. Given the nature and size of the cool rooms, it is imperative that Council is provided with comprehensive details of the installation, and in particular, the method of minimising noise disturbance to adjoining residential development. It is suggested that this should be the subject of an investigation and report by a qualified consultant, as this aspect of the development is probably the one that will cause the most complaints. The following condition should be attached to the Development Consent:\\n'Council must be furnished with a report from a suitably qualified consultant that includes the following:\\n(a)A detailed assessment of background noise levels.\\n(b)A detailed assessment of the type and location of all proposed refrigeration equipment and all associated machinery.\\n(c) A detailed assessment of any operational equipment that is proposed to be used in the processing of the product, and its likely impact on surrounding residential development.\\n(d)An analysis of traffic movement and the likely impact on the surrounding residential development.\\n(e)A detailed proposal that addresses any issues that are identified at items (b) (c) & (d), including, but not limited to, the appropriate design of any noise reducing barriers or enclosures.\\nThis report must be submitted to Council as a part of the documentation required for the assessment of the Construction Certificate'.\\nThere is only a brief reference in the application to odour and it is doubtful that the type of processing involved can be undertaken without creating odour. Given the proximity to residential development, it would be appropriate for the applicant to amplify his statements about this aspect, and perhaps also appropriate for him to provide some form of documentary evidence from a suitably qualified and independent consultant that could confirm his assertions that there will be no odour.\\n46Thirdly, the Council was informed of the assessing officer's consideration of the issues of noise, odour, traffic generation and amenity, as well as liquid trade waste, including how these issues should be addressed by appropriate conditions of consent.\\n47In relation to noise, the officer's report said:\\nAs mentioned above concerns were raised in relation to noise in all three (3) submissions made to Council on the application. These concerns include the potential for noise from:\\ntraffic using the site, vehicles loading and unloading and noise being more of an impact during night time hours;\\nrefrigeration units.\\nAs little documentation has been submitted in relation to the noise generating potential of this development, particularly night time operation it is not surprising that concerns are raised. The DA makes no statement nor provides any information about projected noise levels associated with the development (machinery/ equipment, processes, traffic movements etc) despite being requested to do so in information handed to the applicant in a 'pre-DA' meeting with the applicant on 27 May 2011.\\nThere are no details provided of where compressor/refrigeration units are to be located or on the number and specification of such units. The compressor/refrigeration units are likely to be a source of noise generation and complaint to nearby residences in the evening hours in particular. Traffic movement to and from the site and external activity on site such as loading and unloading is likely to also cause local noise nuisance in the evenings.\\nIt is considered for these reasons that night time operations should not be permitted at this stage. This can be conditioned as part of the development consent. However, should the enterprise operate in a responsible manner it may be possible to consider a section 96 application for modification of consent seeking a variation of approved hours of operation provided that a noise assessment report that meets the guidelines set out in the former NSW EPA's 'NSW industrial noise policy' (including determining the project-specific noise levels, predicting level of noise from the source and determine noise impact, considering mitigation options, negotiation of acceptable level of impact) is submitted by the applicant.\\n48This assessment identifies noise impacts as arising from two sources: traffic using the site, including vehicles loading and unloading, and refrigeration units. Both noise sources would have more impact during night time hours. The officer recommended addressing and mitigating those noise impacts by imposition of conditions. These proposed conditions were included in Schedule 1 to the officer's report.\\n49The officer's proposed conditions 3 and 4 addressed the potential sources of noise from traffic and loading and unloading of vehicles by limiting the hours of operation so as to exclude evening and night time operations. Hence, if conditions 3 and 4 were imposed, there would be no traffic using the site or vehicle loading and unloading in evening or night time hours and hence no noise impact on surrounding residential properties from these potential sources of noise in these hours. Proposed condition 3 stated:\\nApproved hours of operation - The approved hours of operation are:\\nFrom 6am until 6pm, Monday to Friday for any manufacturing, processing, or service and maintenance operations, heavy vehicle deliveries or dispatches, loading and unloading operations.\\nFrom 7am until 5pm [on] Saturdays\\nOn Sundays and Public Holidays there shall be no operations permitted (that is no manufacturing or processing, service and maintenance of vehicles, plant or equipment) however milk delivery trucks will be permitted to deliver to the site on Sundays, but only between the hours of 7am and 6pm.\\nReason - to protect and maintain the amenity of the adjacent residential neighbourhood and to ensure that adjoining residents are not subjected to intrusive and offensive noise, and other impacts that have not been disclosed by the application.\\n50Proposed condition 4 stated:\\nThis Consent specifically excludes the following:\\n(a)Evening or night time operations of any kind or description outside of the approved hours of operation specified in condition 3.\\n(b)Approval for use, for any purpose whatsoever, of the mezzanine area. A separate and specific application and consent to use this space is required.\\nNote: The applicant's attention is drawn to the provisions of the Premises Standards that may affect the use of this area.\\nReason for 4(a) - to maintain the amenity of the adjacent residential neighbourhood and to ensure that adjoining residents are not subjected to intrusive and offensive noise, particularly in the evenings.\\nReason for 4(b) - there is no current approved use of the mezzanine which was indicated on the approved plans for DA 21/02 and CC 88/03 as future office (and future stairs).\\n51The officer's proposed condition 15 addressed the second potential source of noise from the refrigeration units by requiring verification from an acoustical engineer that the refrigeration units would not cause intrusive noise. This verification was required to be submitted before the issue of a construction certificate and hence before the applicant could carry out the development. If verification that the refrigeration units would not cause intrusive noise was not provided, the construction certificate could not be issued and the proposed development could not be carried out. The officer's proposed condition 15 provided:\\nThe applicant must, prior to the issue of a Construction Certificate, provide details of the number, nature and location of internal and external compressors and other refrigeration plant/equipment, including details of enclosure and sound proofing, with verification (e.g. an acoustical engineer's report) that night time operation in particular will not cause an intrusive noise impact ie in general, where the equivalent continuous (energy-average) A-weighted level of noise from the source (represented by the LAeq descriptor), measured over a 15-minute period, does not exceed the background noise level measured in the absence of the source by more than 5 dB (or LAeq 15 minute is less than or equal to rating background level plus 5), where:\\nLAeq 15 minute represents the equivalent continuous (energy average) A-weighted sound pressure level of the source over 15 minutes.\\nNote: Other descriptors may be used as appropriate provided they can be justified on the basis of being characteristic of the source (see Section 2.3 NSW industrial noise policy). This is to be assessed at the most-affected point on or within the residential property boundary - or, if that is more than 30m from the residence, at the most-affected point within 30m of the residence. Rating background level is the background level to be used for assessment purposes as determined by the method outlined in Section 3.1. NSW industrial noise policy.\\nCouncil reserves the right to require the applicant, at their sole cost and expense, to engage the services of an appropriately qualified person to determine compliance with the foregoing condition, in any case where Council is in receipt of a bona fide complaint from any occupant of an affected residence.\\nReason - to ensure that any externally located compressors and other refrigeration plant/equipment not disclosed or documented as part of the application operate within reasonable limits set by noise management guidelines and policy.\\n52The officer's proposed condition 2 provided an additional safeguard limiting the duration of the consent to a trial period of 18 months in order to verify that the development could operate without causing intrusive and offensive noise or impairing the amenity of the neighbourhood. The officer's proposed condition 2 provided:\\nOperational period of consent - Consent to operate the premises in the manner approved is granted for a maximum period of 18 months. This period is to commence from the date of the issue of an Occupation Certificate or Interim Occupation Certificate in respect of this Development Application and Consent. The Council in its absolute discretion will determine whether to extend this period following a review of the operation of the premises over the first twelve months of this period. The period of any extension so granted will be dependent on the satisfactory compliance with the terms of the conditions of consent attached to this Consent.\\nShould the applicant not apply for, or be issued with, an Occupation Certificate or Interim Occupation Certificate, then this consent will lapse 12 months after the date shown on this Development Consent.\\nReason - to protect and maintain the amenity of the adjacent residential neighbourhood and to ensure that adjoining residents are not subjected to intrusive and offensive noise, and other impacts that have not been disclosed by the application.\\n53In relation to odour, the officer's report stated:\\nAgain as mentioned above concerns were raised in relation to possible odour issues in all three (3) submissions made. These concerns are held due to unknown nature of the manufacturing processes involved and from possible break downs and spillages for instance.\\nThe containment and minimisation of spills and the quick cleaning up of spillage will be one key measure to reducing and managing odours as will the adequate treatment and disposal of liquid waste. Also key to odour reduction will be the containment and minimisation of odour from manufacturing processes. There is no detail in particular in relation to this aspect. Processing will occur within the existing but to be modified shed - however there are no details of the nature and kind of potential odours, containment, treatment or otherwise.\\nIn the circumstances it would seem reasonable to issue a time limited consent initially (e.g. 18 months) for an enterprise that operates largely through daylight hours.\\n54The officer's report also dealt with odour in the section on amenity, discussed below.\\n55Attachment 1 to the officer's report contained information from the applicant, including on the issue of odours. In the original statement of environment effects (attached to the officer's report before the Council), the applicant said:\\nBy Products & Waste Water\\nBy-products such as whey that would be generated through the process would be carted off site and fed to stock back at Kerang. The process will not produce odours, and the only waste that will be on the site will be washdown water from the washing of equipment and storage tanks. This water will gravitate to a treatment tank where it will be held and the pH level monitored and treated if necessary. The water would be then pumped into tanks for re-use on gardens or diverted into the sewerage system. These storage tanks would be a total storage volume of 40,000 litres. We believe that we would use approximately 4,000 litres per day. 1,000 litres of this to wash the milk tanker and approximately 2,500 washing pasteurisers, separator, vats and floor. The water will be a combination of hot and cold water, alkaline detergents and caustic soda would be used in the cleaning of the plant which would be the same detergents used in a normal dairy. This water as mentioned will be held, monitored, treated and released.\\n56In the supplementary letter dated 2 August 2011 (also attached to the officer's report before the Council), the applicant said:\\nOdours and Waste\\nThe whey material will be transported off site and the remainder of the product will be processed and packed, so we are confident that there will be no odours. Testimony to this is the current processor that we use in Kyabram, who are processing a far larger quantity of milk than we envisage being done at Barham, their plant is in an industrial estate and there are no smells or odours relative to this amount of processing.\\n57The officer's report did not propose any conditions directly dealing with odour. However, the officer's proposed conditions 3 and 4 limiting the hours of operation by excluding evening and night time operations would limit the potential for emission of odours from processing at those times and hence limit adverse effects from odour. The officer's report also noted that the proposed condition 2 fixing a trial period of 18 months would allow demonstration that the development, which would operate largely through daylight hours, can operate without causing odour impacts as stated by the applicant.\\n58In relation to traffic, the officer's report noted the concerns raised by objectors about additional traffic and noise associated with increased truck movements. The officer's report, in the section on noise and in the proposed conditions, recommended limiting the operation to daytime hours so as to avoid traffic movement to and from the site in the evening and night times. In the section on traffic generation and access, the officer's report also recommended specification of the route of access for heavy vehicles to reduce impacts on local residents:\\nThe route of access for heavy vehicles has not been identified by the applicant. The route of access that is likely to have less impact on the local road system and on local residents is via Moulamein Road, Lawson Street turning into Parkman Ave at its northern end. This is mostly sealed road except for a small section of Parkman Avenue north of the site.\\nAny approval of the development should be conditioned to require that heavy traffic accessing the site be via the northern end of Parkman Ave using Moulamein Road, Lawson Street. This will reduce the impact on the longer length of the unsealed section of Parkman Avenue south of the site and confine such heavier transport movements to mostly sealed road.\\n59The officer's proposed condition 17 implemented this recommendation. It stated:\\nHeavy vehicles traffic accessing the site shall only do so via the northern end of the Parkman Ave using Moulamein Road, Lawson Street. This is the approved heavy vehicle route for the development. In this condition heavy vehicles includes all vehicles larger and heavier than a conventional sedan, station wagon or utility.\\nReason - to reduce the impact on the longer length of the unsealed section of Parkman Avenue south of the site and confine such heavier transport movements to mostly sealed road.\\n60In relation to amenity, the officer's report stated:\\nImpacts on local residential amenity are likely to be associated with any potential noise and odour that might be generated and via heavy truck movements.\\nIn the case of noise if the approval is limited to a specified limited period (e.g. 18 months) and a largely day time enterprise initially and the operation demonstrates that it can perform its business without an unacceptable level of noise approval may be considered to extend the consent for daylight operations (via a modification of development consent process).\\nHowever before an extension of operating hours is considered the applicant should be required to provide a noise assessment report that meets the guidelines set out in the former NSW EPA's 'NSW industrial noise policy' (including determining the project-specific noise levels, predicting level of noise from the source determining noise impact, considering mitigation options, negotiation of acceptable level of impact) that demonstrates that the enterprise can operate within acceptable noise levels against lower background noise levels that prevail at night time.\\nSimilarly, in the case of odour the issue of an initially time limited consent should allow Council to determine if odour emission is an issue with the enterprise. If so extension of the consent and/or operating hours should only [be] considered if either the enterprise has shown to operate with no odour problems or [the] applicant take steps to address the matters by submitting an odour assessment and management study (with a modification of consent application) that addresses this issue particularly addressing means of reducing and managing odours within acceptable levels.\\n61The proposed conditions referred to are those to which reference has already been made, namely the officer's proposed conditions 3 and 4 limiting operation to daylight hours, condition 15 requiring noise assessment and verification before construction, and condition 2 fixing a trial period of 18 months.\\n62In relation to liquid trade waste, the officer's report noted that the proposed development would generate liquid trade waste which would need to be disposed of into the Council's sewer. This required a separate application and approval under s 68 of the Local Government Act 1993. The liquid trade waste application and the approval would address the sources and the proper storage, containment and disposal of liquid waste. The proper storage, containment and disposal of liquid trade waste would mitigate odours from liquid trade waste. The officer's report recommended a condition of consent requiring application and approval for liquid trade waste to be obtained prior to the commencement of the development. The officer's proposed condition 13 stated:\\nAn application and approval under the provisions of Section 68, Local Government Act 1993, to discharge liquid trade waste to Council's sewer system must be obtained from Council prior to the commencement of any operation or process that involves the discharge of any liquid waste to Council's sewer.\\nNote: This application and approval will require the prior concurrence of the NSW Office of Water.\\nReason - to ensure compliance with the Local Government Act 1993 [and] the NSW Government's Liquid Trade Waste Regulation Guidelines.\\n63After dealing with these specific issues, the officer's report assessed generally the relevant matters in s 79C(1) of the EPA Act, including paragraph (b):\\n(b)the likely impacts of that development, including environmental impacts on both the natural and built environments, and social and economic impacts in the locality,\\nComment: the application is not expected to have an adverse environmental, social and economic impact upon the local environment nor upon the natural and built environment of the locality provided the development:\\nis well managed;\\noperates within acceptable environmental limits and within the scale outlined in the application; and\\notherwise complies with approved conditions.\\n64The officer's report concluded that the development application should be supported provided appropriate conditions are imposed. The officer's report stated:\\nIn conclusion it is considered that the development application can be supported provided appropriate conditions are imposed and adhered to so as to ensure that it operates in a manner and at a scale whereby it does not result in any adverse impacts such as noise, odour and poor waste water/liquid trade waste management.\\nThe submissions to the application have been considered and adequately reported on in this report. The proposed development consent conditions outlined in Schedule 1 to this report following the recommendation are proposed to help control impacts of the development, meet statutory requirements and protect the public interest.\\n65The Council, at its meeting on 21 September 2011, considered the officer's report, including the attachments, and resolved unanimously to adopt the recommendation of the officer's report that development consent be granted on the conditions proposed in Schedule 1 to the report. The proposed conditions were renumbered in Schedule 1 to correct a typographical error of having two conditions numbered 4 in the officer's report, but there was no change to the text of the proposed conditions.\\n66By considering the assessment of the relevant matters, including of noise and odour impacts, and the recommendations made in the officer's report, including the recommended conditions to address the relevant matters, the Council took such relevant matters into consideration: Parramatta City Council v Hale at 346.\\n67As I have indicated, the process to be undertaken on judicial review on the ground of failure to consider relevant matters is an evaluative one, based on what the decision-maker has said, written or done. Here, the decision-maker was the Council as a collegiate body. Its consideration of the development application included the consideration of the development application by the officer in the officer's report to the Council. I do not accept Mr Simpson's contention that the officer in his report failed to consider, actually or constructively, the noise and odour impacts.\\n68Although the officer identified that there were deficiencies in the information submitted by the applicant on the impacts of the proposed development, including on the noise and odour impacts, the officer considered that these information deficiencies were able to be overcome by way of imposition of appropriate conditions.\\n69First, the officer noted that noise and odour impacts on surrounding residential areas were of most concern in the evening and night time hours. A solution to not having sufficient information on the noise and odour impacts in those hours of most concern was to preclude operations and any concomitant noise and odour impacts in those hours. This was the solution recommended by the officer and adopted by the Council. Conditions 3 and 4 precluded operation at those times of most concern, resulting in an enterprise that operates only through daylight hours.\\n70Hence, there would be no noise impacts from traffic using the site, vehicles loading and unloading, or traffic passing through the residential streets en route to or from the site, during the evening and night time hours. There would also be no odour impacts from the manufacturing process or breakdowns or spillages during manufacturing process in the evening or night time hours. The only potential source of noise in the evening and night time hours would be from the refrigeration units which would continue to run through those hours. However, condition 16 of the consent (the officer's proposed condition 15) required verification, such as by an acoustical engineer's report, that night time operations in particular will not cause any intrusive noise. Only if such verification were to be provided, could the construction certificate be issued and the development be carried out. This mechanism overcomes the information deficiency regarding noise from the refrigeration units and fixes a performance outcome of no intrusive noise.\\n71Secondly, although noise and odour impacts were of most concern in the evening and night time hours, other conditions did mitigate noise and odour impacts during daylight hours. Noise and dust impacts from traffic passing through residential areas to and from the site were to be mitigated by specification of an access route and confining heavy traffic to that route (condition 18 of the consent and the officer's proposed condition 17). Odour impacts from liquid trade waste generated during operations were to be mitigated by requiring an application and approval under s 68 of the Local Government Act 1993 to discharge liquid trade waste to the Council's sewer system. The process of approval of liquid trade waste involves addressing and requiring the proper storage, containment and disposal of liquid trade waste, thereby minimising odours from the liquid trade waste.\\n72The officer stated in the report that the development was not expected to have an adverse environmental, social or economic impact upon the local environment if it complies with the proposed conditions. However, the officer recommended a further condition to check that adverse impacts do not occur by imposing a trial period of 18 months (condition 2). If the applicant wished to extend the operation of the development beyond the 18 month trial period, it would need to demonstrate that the development can operate without unacceptable noise and odour impacts by reference to its performance during the trial period.\\n73The imposition of a trial period does not involve a failure to take into consideration or a deferral of consideration of likely impacts of a proposed development. As Spigelman CJ held in Zhang v Canterbury City Council [2001] NSWCA 167; (2001) 51 NSWLR 589; (2001) 115 LGERA 373 at [83]-[85]:\\nI do not see any necessary incompatibility between the imposition of a condition limiting a proposed use to a probationary or trial period and the statutory requirement that the decision-maker 'take into consideration' both the 'likely impact of the development' and 'the suitability of the site for the development'. It is possible to 'take into consideration' matters even though their full significance cannot be known with precision.\\nWhere, as in this case, the nature of the development application is for the 'use' of existing premises - and, accordingly, adverse effects are readily reversible - a probationary or trial period may be an appropriate exercise of the statutory discretion.\\nThe implications of the approach adopted by Talbot J would unnecessarily limit the statutory power to permit development for a specific period where the full implications of the development are not known or cannot be stated with sufficient certainty. In any such case, the 'likely impact' or 'suitability' will never be capable of complete assessment. Indeed, that is the very purpose of the probationary or trial period. The scope and purpose of the Act is better served by permitting experimentation, at least in circumstances where adverse effects will cease if the development consent were not, in the event, extended. The focus is then on 'likely impact' during the probationary period.\\n74The proposed development in this case also involves a use of existing premises (for a dairy processing plant), and any adverse impacts, including noise and odour impacts, are readily reversible. Imposition of a trial period was an appropriate exercise of the statutory discretion.\\n75Hence, I do not accept Mr Simpson's submission that the insufficiency in the information on the noise and odour impacts before the Council did not enable it to discharge its duty to take into consideration noise and odour impacts in determining the development application. This is not a case where a decision-maker has merely adverted to or paid lip service to the relevant matters. The relevant matters have been identified, analysed and addressed by appropriate conditions of consent.\\n76I also do not accept Mr Simpson's submission that the Council, by imposing conditions 2 (the trial period) and 16 (the verification of no intrusive noise), deferred for later consideration noise and odour impacts.\\n77As I have stated, condition 16 effectively fixes and implements a performance outcome of no intrusive noise from the proposed development's refrigeration units. The condition ensures the development will meet this performance outcome by requiring verification before a construction certificate can be issued and the development carried out. The facts that details of the refrigeration units and verification that the refrigeration units will not cause an intrusive noise impact are to be submitted after consent has been granted, and that council officers may need to assess the adequacy of submitted information and supervise compliance, does not mean that the Council has deferred consideration of noise impacts or not finally determined the development application. Retention of practical flexibility, leaving matters of detail for later determination, and delegation of supervision of some stage or aspect of the development, may all be desirable and be in accordance with the statutory scheme under the EPA Act: see Scott v Wollongong City Council (1992) 75 LGRA 112 at 118; Transport Action Group Against Motorways Inc v Roads & Traffic Authority [1999] NSWCA 196; (1999) 46 NSWLR 598; (1999) 104 LGERA 133 at [117]-[122]; Winn v Director General of National Parks and Wildlife [2001] NSWCA 17; (2001) 130 LGERA 508 at [17]-[19], [32], [39], [108], [124]; Kindimindi Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Cove Council [2006] NSWCA 23; (2006) 143 LGERA 277 at [55]; Hurstville City Council v Renaldo Plus 3 Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 248 at [89]; Ulan Coal Mines Ltd v Minister for Planning [2008] NSWLEC 185; (2008) 160 LGERA 20 at [78].\\n78Condition 2, setting a trial period to enable assessment of whether, and demonstration that, the noise and odour impacts of the development are as predicted and are acceptable, is also an appropriate exercise of the discretionary power and within the statutory scheme: Zhang v Canterbury City Council at [84], [85].\\n79For these reasons, I find that Mr Simpson has not established that the Council failed to take into consideration the relevant matters of the noise and odour impacts of the proposed development in determining the development application.\\n\\n\\nRemedy for breach of failure to notify\\n\\n\\nThe parties' competing contentions on discretion\\n\\n\\n80I have found that the Council failed to notify the development application in breach of DCP 8 and s 79A(2) of the EPA Act. Mr Simpson submits that the appropriate order to remedy that breach is to declare invalid the development consent. The Council would then be required to notify the development application in accordance with DCP 8 and reconsider and redetermine the development application, taking into account any submissions received in response to the notification. Mr Simpson submits that the notification requirements of DCP 8 and s 79A(2) of the EPA Act are important community participation provisions of the EPA Act and should be upheld: Johnson v Lake Macquarie City Council (1996) 91 LGERA 331 at 341-342.\\n81The consent holder submits that the Court should exercise its discretion not to declare the development consent invalid or, instead of declaring the development consent to be invalid, make an order under s 25B(1) of the Court Act. The consent holder submits the breach is minor and, in any event, notification to other persons in accordance with DCP 8 and s 79A(2) of the EPA Act would not add to the considerations under s 79C of the EPA Act or lead to a different result. The consent holder referred to the evidence of persons who claimed to be adversely affected by the proposed development, and hence persons who would be notified in accordance with DCP 8, that the matters they would raise in their submissions objecting to the proposed development would be the same as the matters that were raised by the three occupiers of land adjoining the site of the proposed development in their submissions to the Council. These were the matters of noise, odour, traffic generation and loss of amenity summarised in the officer's report. The consent holder submits, therefore, that any further submissions of affected owners and occupiers of land would not raise any new matters and therefore would not lead to the Council determining the development application differently.\\n\\n\\nDiscretion to decline relief\\n82I will start with the consent holder's submission that, in the exercise of the Court's discretion to remedy the breach, a declaration of invalidity should not be made.\\n83Courts have held repeatedly that statutory requirements for notification and advertising of development applications are mandatory and the observance of the requirements of notification and advertising is a condition precedent to the exercise of the statutory power to determine the development application by the consent authority. A purported exercise of the statutory power has no validity where a condition for the exercise of the power has not been fulfilled: SS Constructions Pty Ltd v Ventura Motors Pty Ltd [1964] VR 229 at 245-246; (1963) 10 LGRA 210 at 230-231; Scurr v Brisbane City Council (1973) 133 CLR 242 at 255-256; Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd v Brisbane City Council (1980) 145 CLR 485 at 518; CSR Ltd v Yarrowlumla Shire Council (Unreported, Land and Environment Court of NSW, Cripps J, 2 August 1985) at 9-10; Monaro Acclimatisation Society v Minister for Planning (Unreported, Land and Environment Court of NSW, Stein J, 2 March 1989).\\n84The failure to comply with the statutory requirements in DCP 8 and s 79A(2) of the EPA Act for notification of the development application was not a minor or merely technical breach of the EPA Act: Nelson v Burwood Municipal Council (1991) 75 LGRA 39 at 45; Curac v Shoalhaven City Council (1993) 81 LGERA 124 at 129.\\n85Compliance with mandatory, statutory requirements for notification and advertisement is in the public interest. As Stein J noted in Curac v Shoalhaven City Council at 128: '[r]easonable opportunities for public participation in plan making and in the development process are crucial to the integrity of the planning system provided under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act.' Statutory provisions requiring notification and advertising of development applications, such as ss 79 and 79A of the EPA Act, are 'requirements intended to ensure public participation in the planning process. They are, in effect, statutory requirements to service the public interest inherent in the objective contained in s 5(c)' of the EPA Act. See also Broomham v Tallaganda Shire Council (Unreported, Land and Environment Court of NSW, Stein J, 31 October 1986) at 5; Johnson v Lake Macquarie City Council at 341; Boral Resources (Country) Pty Ltd v Clarence Valley Council (No 2) [2009] NSWLEC 133 at [18].\\n86More recently, Craig J observed in Csillag v Woollahra Council [2011] NSWLEC 17 at [32], [33]:\\nBy requiring the advertising and notification of development applications, the DCP is giving effect to an important object of the EPA Act. That object, as expressed in s 5(c), is 'to provide increased opportunity for public involvement and participation in environmental planning and assessment.' Relevantly, s 79A(2) gives statutory force to the DCP by mandating notification and advertisement of a development application in accordance with its provisions (Lesnewski v Mosman Municipal Council [2005] NSWCA 99; (2005) 138 LGERA 207 at [58]).\\nThe purpose achieved by giving effect to the legislative object is twofold. First, it affords a form of procedural fairness by providing an opportunity to those who have an interest in or who may be affected by proposed development to learn of its detail before any decision is made. Secondly, it affords the opportunity to improve the process of decision making by enabling the consent authority to make a decision, fully informed of the potential consequences of development as perceived by the community.\\n87I do not accept the consent holder's submission that the giving of notice in accordance with DCP 8 and s 79A(2) of the EPA Act would have made no difference. Again, courts have held repeatedly that the court cannot know whether, if notice had been given in accordance with statutory notification and advertising requirements, other objectors would have made submissions, or made submissions raising different grounds of objection, or even if raising the same grounds as other objectors had raised, referred to different facts and circumstances in support of those grounds, or put their objection differently and perhaps more persuasively: see Scurr v Brisbane City Council at 251-252, 257-258; Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd v Brisbane City Council at 518; Nelson v Burwood Municipal Council at 43-44; Curac v Shoalhaven City Council at 130; Helman v Byron Shire Council (1995) 87 LGERA 349 at 360; Johnson v Lake Macquarie City Council at 342; Smith v Wyong Shire Council [2003] NSWCA 322; (2003) 132 LGERA 148 at [179]-[180].\\n88By its failure to comply with the statutory requirements for notification of the development application, the Council deprived itself of the opportunity of considering submissions of other owners and objectors who may be affected by the proposed development.\\n89The Court cannot know whether the Council would have made the same determination of the development application had it complied with the statutory requirements for notification. If other objectors had made submissions raising different grounds of objection or stating their objections differently, the Court cannot conclude that the Council would have been unmoved by the number of submissions objecting to the development and the content of those submissions, and instead made the same determination to grant development consent and on the same conditions without any modification. As Stein J said in Nelson v Burwood Municipal Council at 45, in response to a similar discretion argument that the giving of notice of a development application would have made no difference:\\nWho knows? Ms Mitchelmore submits that no injustice has been worked by Council's failure to notify residents because their views were known and taken into account. Again, this statement is hypothetical because the possible objectors and their objections cannot be known.\\n90As far as other factors relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion, such as the guidelines discussed in Warringah Shire Council v Sedevcic (1987) 10 NSWLR 335 at 339-340; (1987) 63 LGRA 361 at 365-366, these do not support declining to make a declaration of invalidity.\\n91As I have said, the breach was not a purely a technical breach. There was no material delay in bringing the proceedings, causing prejudice to the consent holder. The consent holder has not implemented the development consent by carrying out the development as of yet.\\n92The orders sought involve the enforcement of not a private right but rather a public duty imposed by the EPA Act, to uphold the public interest in public participation in the development approval process.\\n93There are no circumstances justifying the Council's non-compliance with the notification requirements.\\n94The orders sought concern development involving a prospective change of use, not a static development that has already occurred, and therefore, is able to be restrained readily and at no great cost. The breach can be remedied by the Council complying with the notification requirements and reconsidering and redetermining the development application taking into account submissions received in response to the notification of the development application.\\n95In these circumstances, I consider it would not be appropriate or just to exercise the discretion not to make a declaration of invalidity. To do so would condone the breach of a mandatory statutory requirement in the public interest and leave it unremedied.\\n\\n\\nDiscretion under s 25B of the Court Act\\n96I now turn to consider s 25B of the Court Act. Section 25B gives the Court a discretion to make orders which will validate a development consent instead of declaring it invalid. The Court has a duty to consider making an order under s 25B instead of declaring a development consent invalid: see s 25E of the Court Act and Kindimindi Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Cove City Council [2007] NSWCA 38; (2007) 150 LGERA 333 at [23], [27], [47]. Section 25B provides:\\n(1)The Court may, instead of declaring or determining that a development consent to which this Division applies is invalid, whether in whole or in part, make an order:\\n(a)suspending the operation of the consent in whole or in part, and\\n(b)specifying terms compliance with which will validate the consent (whether without alterations or on being regranted with alterations).\\n(2)Terms may include (without limitation):\\n(a)terms requiring the carrying out again of steps already carried out, or\\n(b)terms requiring the carrying out of steps not already commenced or carried out, or\\n(c)terms requiring acts, matters or things to be done or omitted that are different from acts, matters or things required to be done or omitted by or under this Act or any other Act.\\n97If the Court makes an order under s 25B, the Council as the consent authority can do three things: first, it can revoke the development consent, whether or not the terms imposed by the Court under s 25B of the Court Act have been complied with (s 103(2) of the EPA Act); secondly, if the terms imposed by the Court under s 25B of the Court Act have been substantially complied with, it can regrant consent by revoking the original development consent whose operation has been suspended by the Court under s 25B of the Court Act, and granting a new development consent with such alterations to the revoked consent as the consent authority thinks appropriate having regard to the terms themselves and to any matters arising in the course of complying with the terms (s 103(2) of the EPA Act); and thirdly, it can apply to the Court for an order under s 25C of the Court Act, on the grounds that the terms specified under s 25B of the Court Act have been substantially complied with and that either it is not proposed to regrant development consent with alterations or that development consent has been regranted with alterations, declaring that the terms have been substantially complied with or complied with, the original consent or the regranted consent is valid, and/or the suspended development consent has been revoked, and/or revoking the order of suspension (see s 25C(1) and (2) of the Court Act).\\n98A development consent declared to be valid under s 25C of the Court Act is final and operative from the date the consent originally took effect and a regranted development consent declared under s 25C of the Court Act to be validly regranted is also final and takes effect from the date of the declaration or another date specified by the Court (s 104(1) and (2) of the EPA Act).\\n99This process of suspension of an original development consent and validation either of the original consent or a regranted consent has been discussed recently and thoughtfully by Biscoe J in Hoxton Park Residents Action Group Inc v Liverpool City Council (No 3) [2012] NSWLEC 43 at [30]-[46].\\n100A significant difficulty in making a suspension order under s 25B and a subsequent validation order under s 25C is being able to craft appropriate orders which will not only lead to a validation of either the original consent or the regranted consent, but to do so in a way which does not impede or frustrate the objects of the statutory notification requirements breached and the intended statutory process for consideration and determination of a development application.\\n101In the circumstances of this case, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to suspend the operation of the development consent on terms that the Council give notice of the development application in accordance with DCP 8 and s 79A(2) of the EPA Act and then reconsider and redetermine the development application taking into account any submissions received in response to the notification.\\n102As I have observed earlier, compliance with the mandatory requirements for notification of development applications is in the public interest. Public participation in the development process is crucial to the integrity of the planning system under the EPA Act and promotes the objects of the EPA Act. It is not to be viewed as a technical and tokenistic speed hump designed to slow but not divert or prevent the inexorable passage of a development application along the highway to approval. To the contrary, if notification is undertaken in accordance with the statutory requirements, the consent authority's consideration and determination of the development application might change.\\n103One cannot know who might make submissions in response to being notified, what the content of their submissions might be, how cogent or compelling their submissions might be, or how the Council might consider and weigh their submissions. The matters the Council as consent authority is obliged to consider under s 79C of the EPA Act, the facts and circumstances of the matters, and the relative weight to be assigned to the matters, might all change as a result of the new submissions and the Council's consideration of them. There is utility in having the process of notification, submission, consideration and determination of the development application undertaken in accordance with the EPA Act. This should be done not in the shadow and servitude of a suspended existing development consent pending validation but in the light and freedom of a development application that has become undetermined by reason of the existing development consent being set aside.\\n104I consider that the circumstances of this case are distinguishable from those, and justify a different exercise of discretion from that, in Csillag v Woollahra Council [2011] NSWLEC 17 and Csillag v Woollahra Council (No 2) [2012] NSWLEC 135 where Craig J did make an order under s 25B of the Court Act suspending the operation of a development consent on terms requiring renotification and readvertising of a development application and an order under s 25C of the Court Act declaring that the development consent had been validly regranted. In that case, there was proper notification to owners of adjoining and neighbouring land in accordance with the applicable development control plan as well as an advertisement in the local newspaper, however the advertisement insufficiently described the address of the land to which the proposed alterations to the apartment related. In the present case, there was no compliance with the notification requirements in DCP 8 at all and in particular no notification was given to owners and occupiers of land that may be affected by the proposed development. Therefore, the breach was different to the breach in the present case.\\n105The nature of the proposed development and its impacts in that case were also different to the present case. There, the proposed development involved alterations and additions to one apartment in a residential flat building. Craig J found that, without suggesting that the alterations and additions could have no external impact, it would appear that the impacts, if any, would be limited to relatively few people: Csillag v Woollahra Council [2011] NSWLEC 17 at [59]. Moreover, the proposed alterations and additions were, by any objective standard, relatively small in their scope of work and cost (at [59]). In those circumstances, Craig J considered it appropriate to suspend the operation of the consent under s 25B of the Court Act. In contrast, the proposed development in the present case is of an industrial nature likely to have external impacts in terms of noise, odour, traffic generation and loss of amenity, which have more potential to adversely affect more people in the neighbourhood of the proposed dairy processing plant.\\n106For these reasons, I do not consider it appropriate to make an order under s 25B of the Court Act instead of declaring the development consent invalid.\\n\\n\\nCosts\\n\\n\\n107The applicant and consent holder have not yet made submissions as to costs. The Council made a submitting appearance save as to costs. The parties should be given an opportunity to make their submissions on costs. Accordingly, I reserve the question of costs to allow the parties to apply, within seven days, to list the matter to obtain a date for a hearing on costs.\\n\\n\\nOrders\\n\\n\\n108The Court:\\n(1)Declares that the development consent for development application no DA 31/11 granted by Wakool Shire Council to Jonesy's Dairy Fresh Pty Ltd dated 28 September 2011 for the change of use to a dairy processing plant at 49 Parkman Avenue, Barham, being Lots 47, 94 and 115 in DP 756508, is invalid.\\n(2)Reserves the question of costs.\\n(3)Directs the parties, within 7 days, to apply to the Court to list the matter for a hearing on costs.\\n\\n\\n**********\\nDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.
