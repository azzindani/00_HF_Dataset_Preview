The Parties agree as follows:\\n\\n1. \\u00a0\\u00a0SERVICES\\n\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0(a)\\u00a0\\u00a0Global Crossing shall, in accordance with this Agreement, provide\\nExodus with telecommunications capacity, comprising [***] DS-0 channel miles\\n(the \\u201cTotal Initial Channel Miles\\u201d). Such capacity will include 9.953 Gbps\\nLinear Wavelength Services (as such services become available) and 2.488 Gbps\\nLinear Wavelength Services (the \\u201cWavelength Services\\u201d) and OC-12 and OC-3 SONET\\nservices (the \\u201cSONET Services\\u201d) between the city pairs defined in Exhibit A\\nattached hereto and made part hereof (\\u201cCity Pairs\\u201d). As circuits are accepted,\\nthe DS-0 miles associated with such circuit will be deducted against the Total\\nInitial Channel Miles. Within sixty (60) days after execution of this Agreement,\\nthe parties will establish procedures for auditing the Total Initial Channel\\nMiles. The minimum term for all circuits shall be [***]. Global Crossing will\\nprovide SONET Services and Wavelength Services in accordance with the Technical\\nSpecifications set forth in Exhibit C. Exodus may order additional capacity\\npursuant to such other exhibits as the Parties may from time to time execute and\\nattach hereto (the \\u201cExhibits\\u201d), upon the same terms as to pricing, payment\\narrangements and term of Agreement as set forth in Article 2. All capacity under\\nthe Exhibits is collectively referred to as the \\u201cServices\\u201d.

If the new\\ncircuit is for a greater number of DS-0 channel miles, upon Acceptance (as\\ndefined below) of the new circuit, the higher number of DS-0 channel miles will\\nbegin to be deducted against the Total Initial Channel Miles. If the new circuit\\nis for a lower number of DS-0 channel miles, and the existing circuit has been\\nin service less than [***], the number of DS-0 miles associated with the\\nexisting circuit will continue to be deducted from the Total Initial Channel\\nMiles for the remainder of such [***] period in addition to the applicable\\ndeduction for the new circuit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may\\nthe capacity level for any physical route exceed the equivalent of (2) 9.953\\nGbps circuits, without Global Crossing\\u2019s consent, which shall not unreasonably\\nbe withheld. If Exodus orders additional capacity under this Agreement then for\\neach subsequent billion DS-0 channel miles ordered, the capacity level for any\\nphysical route will not exceed the equivalent of (2) 9.953 Gbps circuits,\\nwithout Global Crossing\\u2019s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.\\n\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0(d)\\u00a0\\u00a0Exodus shall have the right at any time to replace any previously\\ninstalled circuit between any City Pair with a circuit of greater DS-0 miles\\nbetween the same City Pair at no additional charge except for as set forth\\nbelow.

Upon the Borrower's compliance with the Special Performance conditions\\nas set forth in the Loan Agreement, the Interest Rate will be reduced to the\\nLIBOR Market Index Rate plus 2.00%. \\\"LIBOR Market Index Rate\\\", for any day, is\\nthe rate for 1 month U.S. dollar deposits as reported on Telerate page 3750 as\\nof 11:00 a.m., London time, on such day, or if such day is not a London business\\nday, then the immediately preceding London business day (or if not so reported,\\nthen as determined by Bank from another recognized source or interbank\\nquotation).\\n\\n\\n\\nDEFAULT RATE.\\n\\nIn addition to all other rights contained in this Note, if a Default (as defined\\nherein) occurs and as long as a Default continues, all outstanding Obligations\\nshall bear interest at the Interest Rate plus 3% (\\\"Default Rate\\\"). The Default\\nRate shall also apply from acceleration until the Obligations or any judgment\\nthereon is paid in full.\\n\\n\\n\\nINTEREST AND FEE(S) COMPUTATION\\n\\n(ACTUAL/360). Interest and fees, if any, shall be computed on the basis of a\\n360-day year for the actual number of days in the applicable period (\\\"Actual/360\\nComputation\\\"). The Actual/360 Computation determines the annual effective\\ninterest yield by taking the stated (nominal) rate for a year's period and then\\ndividing said rate by 360 to determine the daily periodic rate to be applied for\\neach day in the applicable period. Application of the Actual/360 Computation\\nproduces an annualized effective rate exceeding the nominal rate.\\n\\n\\n\\nOPTIONAL HEDGE.\\n\\nBorrower shall have the option to hedge the floating interest expense on up to\\n$2,500,000.00 of permanent borrowings by converting the interest rate on these\\nborrowings to 30 day LIBOR plus 2.50% and entering into an interest rate swap\\n(the \\\"Swap\\\") with the Bank (or other counterparty acceptable to Bank)\\ncontemporaneously with the closing of the loan, pursuant to which Borrower shall\\nreceive the amount necessary to pay the interest expense due under the loan\\n(exclusive of default interest or other adjustments provided for in the loan\\ndocuments) and shall pay the amount that would be equal to the interest that\\nwould accrue on the loan at a fixed rate. Bank is willing to provide this\\n\\n\\n\\n<PAGE> 1\\n\\nSwap to Borrower upon mutually agreeable terms. The actual rate is subject to\\nmarket conditions at the time the Swap is consummated. The Swap will be governed\\nby an ISDA Master Agreement and shall be secured by the Collateral described\\nherein.\\n\\nREPAYMENT TERMS.\\n\\nThis Note shall be due and payable in consecutive monthly payments of accrued\\ninterest only, commencing on November 1, 2000, and continuing on the same day of\\neach month thereafter until fully paid. In any event, all principal and accrued\\ninterest shall be due and payable on September 30, 2002.\\n\\n\\n\\nBank may (but shall not be obligated to) receive payments due hereunder by\\ndirect debit from Borrower's account with Bank being account number DDA 207 996\\n000 1644 (Routing No. 021101108).\\n\\nAVAILABILITY FEE.\\n\\nBorrower shall pay to Bank quarterly an availability fee equal to 0.25% per\\nannum on the average daily unused principal amount available under the Note for\\nthe preceding calendar quarter or portion thereof, commencing on December 26,\\n2000 and continuing on the same day of each quarterly anniversary thereafter,\\nwith a final payment due and payable on the date that all principal and accrued\\ninterest is paid in full.\\n\\n\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.\\n\\nMonies received by Bank from any source for application toward payment of the\\nObligations shall be applied to accrued interest and then to principal. If a\\nDefault occurs, monies may be applied to the Obligations in any manner or order\\ndeemed appropriate by Bank.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf any payment received by Bank under this Note or other Loan Documents is\\nrescinded, avoided or for any reason returned by Bank because of any adverse\\nclaim or threatened action, the returned payment shall remain payable as an\\nobligation of all persons liable under this Note or other Loan Documents as\\nthough such payment had not been made.\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\\nSeller and the Purchaser may mutually agree that, in lieu of including any\\nModified Loan(s) in the Primary Portfolio or Secondary Portfolio, as applicable,\\nthe Seller may designate Additional Mortgage Loans or pay the Purchaser in cash,\\nin either case in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Primary\\nPortfolio Excess Spread or Secondary Portfolio Excess Spread relating to such\\nModified Loan(s).\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(f) The Seller shall be required to designate Additional Mortgage Loans as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(i) On or before the Mortgage Loan Identification Date, the Seller shall\\ncalculate the Shortfall Amount, if any, with respect to such calendar month and\\nshall furnish the same to the Purchaser along with commercially reasonable\\ndocumentation supporting such calculation.
